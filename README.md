# Weekly Project: Responsive Website Development

Welcome to my **Weekly Project on Responsive Website Development**! In this repository, I will showcase my work on creating a fully responsive website layout. This project is part of my ongoing journey in the **Epicode Front-End Development** course, where I focus on mastering the essentials of modern web design.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and develop a website that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using HTML and CSS:

- **Fluid Layouts** - Utilizing percentages and flexible grid systems.
- **Media Queries** - Applying CSS rules at different breakpoints for optimal viewing experiences.
- **Mobile-First Design** - Prioritizing mobile layout and progressively enhancing for larger screens.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility** - Ensuring the website performs consistently across different browsers.

**IMPORTANT**: MEDIA QUERY cannot be used so there are 2 version, one for desktop and one for mobile.

**Note**: In this project, I will not be using **Flexbox**. Instead, I will focus on traditional CSS techniques and layouts.
